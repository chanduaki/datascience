ML stands for "Machine Learning." 
ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data, improve their performance over time, and make accurate predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
ML algorithms analyze large datasets, recognize patterns, and adapt to new information to make informed decisions. 
Applications of ML include image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommender systems, and personalized advertising.
